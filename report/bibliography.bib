	abstract={In this paper we investigate the use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as a performance measure for machine learning algorithms. As a case study we evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six “real world” medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for “single number” evaluation of machine learning algorithms.},

        abstract =       {Information Retrieval (IR) is a large and growing field within Natural Language Processing (NLP). The search engine is the most well-known (and perhaps still the only really useful) application. Search engines like Google and AltaVista are used by many people on a daily basis. There are several other applications within IR. Among them this text considers text clustering in particular. A text clustering algorithm partitions a set of texts so that texts within the same group are as similar in content as possible. It is done without using any predefined categories. Text clustering can for instance be applied to the documents retrieved by a search engine, so that they can be presented in groups according to content.}

	title={Indexing by latent semantic analysis},
	journal={Journal of the American Society for Information Science},
	volume={41},
	number={6},
	pages={391-407},
	abstract={Abstract A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (“semantic structure”) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising. © 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},
